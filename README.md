Employee Payroll System using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

Welcome to the Employee Payroll System project in Java! This repository contains a comprehensive example of building a terminal-based Employee Payroll System using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. Through this project, I learned how to design and implement abstract classes, concrete subclasses, and explore inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction, and polymorphism in Java.

üîç Project Highlights:

Abstract Employee class serving as the foundation for different employee types. Concrete subclasses FullTimeEmployee and PartTimeEmployee with salary calculation. A user-friendly terminal interface for easy interaction and data management. Demonstrates core OOP concepts with practical coding examples.

SUMMARY : 
Employee Payroll System: A Comprehensive Java-Based OOP Project

Tech Stack: Java, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Project Overview: Developed an advanced Employee Payroll System using Java, leveraging core OOP principles like Abstraction, Inheritance, Encapsulation, and Polymorphism.

Key Contributions:
Abstract Class Implementation: Designed an abstract Employee class with specialized subclasses for FullTimeEmployee and PartTimeEmployee, enabling flexible and scalable payroll management.
Salary Calculation Engine: Engineered a robust system for calculating salaries based on distinct employee types, ensuring accurate and efficient payroll processing.

Employee Management System: Implemented a comprehensive PayrollSystem class to handle employee records, including adding, updating, and removing employees, thereby optimizing payroll operations.\

Impact:
Showcases OOP Expertise: Demonstrates a solid understanding of advanced OOP concepts and their application in real-world software development.
Problem-Solving Proficiency: Highlights ability to design and implement effective solutions for complex business processes.
Portfolio-Worthy: Ready for presentation in interviews, with code hosted on GitHub to exemplify coding skills and project execution.
